<p>MapIt is a service that maps geographical points to administrative areas.
This edition is based on source data from the totally amazing

MapIt is useful for anyone who has the co-ordinates of a point in Kosovo, and
who needs to find out what municipality it lies within. It&rsquo;s also great for looking up the shapes of all those
boundaries.
